### Easy Recipe Management

service: recipecards.add_recipe
data:
  title: "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
  description: "Classic homemade cookies"
  ingredients:
    - "2 cups flour"
    - "1 cup butter"
    - "1 cup chocolate chips"
  notes: "Bake at 350¬∞F for 12 minutes"
  instructions:
    - "Mix dry ingredients in a bowl"
