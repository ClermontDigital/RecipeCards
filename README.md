## Quick Setup

### Requirements
- Home Assistant 2024.1+
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

### Installation
1. **HACS**: Add custom repository `https://github.com/ClermontDigital/RecipeCards`
2. **Manual**: Download and extract to `/config/custom_components/recipecards/`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add integration via Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services

### Configuration
1. **Add RecipeCards Integration (Multiple Entries Supported):**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
   - Click "Add Integration"
   - Search for "Recipe Cards"
   - You can optionally enter a full initial recipe (title, description, ingredients, notes, instructions, color). Use one line per ingredient/instruction.
   - Submit to create the entry

   After the first entry, you can use the blue "Add entry" button on the
   Recipe Cards integration page to add more entries. Each entry creates:
   - A collection device called "Recipe Cards" for that entry, and
   - One device per recipe (exposed as a sensor with recipe attributes)

2. **Add Lovelace Card:**
   - No build step required. The card is auto-loaded and auto-registered as a Lovelace resource by the integration on storage dashboards.
   - Edit your dashboard ‚Üí Add card ‚Üí Manual
   - YAML:
     - `type: custom:recipecards-card`
     - `entity: sensor.recipe_cards`

   If you use YAML‚Äëmode dashboards, add a resource manually:
   ```yaml
   lovelace:
     resources:
       - url: /recipecards/recipecards-card.js
         type: module
   ```

## Usage

### Entities Created
- `sensor.recipe_cards` (per entry) ‚Äì Shows total number of stored recipes with recipe data in attributes
- `sensor.<recipe_title>` (per recipe) ‚Äì A sensor entity representing a single recipe. Its attributes include `title`, `description`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, `notes`, and `color`.

### Easy Recipe Management

RecipeCards now provides **simplified** recipe management - no config entry IDs needed! If you have multiple entries, the built‚Äëin UI and API aggregate recipes from all entries. You can still target a specific entry by passing `config_entry_id` (services) or `entry_id` (WebSocket API).

**Add Recipe (Simple):**
```yaml
service: recipecards.add_recipe
data:
  title: "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
  description: "Classic homemade cookies"
  ingredients:
    - "2 cups flour"
    - "1 cup butter"
    - "1 cup chocolate chips"
  notes: "Bake at 350¬∞F for 12 minutes"
  instructions:
    - "Mix dry ingredients in a bowl"
    - "Cream butter and add to mixture"
    - "Form cookies and bake until golden"
  color: "#FF6B35"
```

**Update Recipe:**
```yaml
service: recipecards.update_recipe
data:
  recipe_id: "your-recipe-id"
  title: "Updated Chocolate Chip Cookies"
  description: "Improved recipe with better ingredients"
  color: "#E91E63"
```

**Delete Recipe:**
```yaml
service: recipecards.delete_recipe
data:
  recipe_id: "your-recipe-id"
```

> **Note:** Config entry IDs are now auto-detected! You only need to specify `config_entry_id` if you have multiple RecipeCards integrations.

### New Recipe Collection View

The RecipeCards card now features two modes:

1. **Collection View (Default)**: Browse all recipes as colored tiles with built-in add/edit/delete functionality
2. **Detail View**: Classic single-recipe card with flip animation

**Basic Setup:**
```yaml
type: custom:recipecards-card
entity: sensor.recipe_cards
title: "My Recipe Collection"
```

**Force Detail View:**
```yaml
type: custom:recipecards-card
entity: sensor.recipe_cards
view: detail
```

- **Delete**: Click "Delete" on any recipe tile
- **View**: Click any recipe tile or switch to detail view

### Method 2: Developer Tools (For Automation)
For creating automations or scripts:

2. Choose `recipecards.add_recipe`
3. Fill the form (no config entry ID needed)

### Method 3: Service Calls (Advanced)
Use in automations or scripts:
```yaml
service: recipecards.add_recipe
data:
  title: "My Recipe"
  description: "A delicious recipe"
  ingredients:
    - "Ingredient 1"
    - "Ingredient 2"
  instructions:
    - "Step 1"
    - "Step 2"
  color: "#FF6B35"
```

### Method 4: Options Flow (Add via Settings)
From the integration entry row, click Configure. Choose "Add recipe" to add recipes directly from the options dialog (newline‚Äëseparated ingredients/instructions). Repeat to add multiple; choose "Finish" when done.

## Troubleshooting

- **Card not displaying**: Check that recipes exist and the Lovelace card is properly configured
- **Tab bar not showing**: Ensure you have multiple recipes added to see the tab navigation
- **Integration not loading**: Restart Home Assistant after installation
- **Recipes not saving**: Verify the integration is properly configured

Enable debug logging:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.recipecards: debug
